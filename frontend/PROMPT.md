Build a clean and minimalist web app called TLDR. The app has two pages, that are views of the two db tables sources and articles. See the schema in database/init.sql

1. **sources**: a list of sources are rendered as list. It can be edited by clicking on it.
2. **articles**: a list of the most recent articles sorted by time (latest first). Clicking on the article shows the text of the article as well.

The backend API documented in @backend/README.md
